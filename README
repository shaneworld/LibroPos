WHY I CREATE THIS PROJECT?

There is a bookstore next to my school. I had a very bad experience using the 
backend POS system of this bookstore, so I wanted to write a clear and easy-to-use 
backend POS system based on Java and SpringBoot.

WHAT HAVE I ACCOMPLISHED?

o Login page using thymeleaf.
o User-related tables in [MariaDB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MariaDB).

WHAT AM I CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING?

o JWT Token Authentication.
o MD5 password encryption.
o Double Interceptor.
o Redis as session cache.
o Login Log.
o Multi-factor authentication.
